# CFA Database

This repository represents the latest database edition for CFA. It can be used in conjunction with auto updates or on its own.

## How to use with CFA

To use the database without auto updates you have to:

1. Download or clone the whole repository and then extract it on top of your CFA.
2. Copy Version.ini from the root into Text folder.

This will provide you with a working copy of CFA even if your auto updates are not working for some reason (e.g. you are using a Windows emulator).

For new updates, you will have to redownload the repository every time a new update releases, so it is better to just clone the repository and pull from it.

## Development

### Text Data

The `Text` folder contains individual fraction text files written in GML. New entries are added consecutively into their respective files, depending on clan/nation. Please be aware that all of the text files in this repository use Windows-1251 encoding for compatibility purposes. The exact syntax of those files will be outlined in a section below.

### Image Data

`CardSprite` and `CardSpriteMini2` contains images that correspond to the database entries, every image is stored in `.jpg` format and their names start with an `n` and then contains a card number.

`Sprite` folder contains sleeve images, which are all named with letter `s` and then their respective number, in `.png` format. New sleeves should be added consequitevely.

- `CardSprite` and `Sleeves` images should be 300 pixels in width and approximately 437 pixels in height
- `SleevesMini` folder is only present for sleeves. Images here should be 60 pixels in width and approximately 86 pixels in height.
- `CardSpriteMini2` and `SleevesMini2` images should be 75 pixels in width and approximately 109 pixels in height.

It is strongly adivsed to compress the `.jpg` card images after resizing them to reduce the amount of time and traffic needed to download the images. You can use [kraken.io](https://kraken.io/web-interface) website to resize images en masse, for example.

After new card images are added, do not forget to update the `.md5sums` files by running `md5.bat` file if you're on Windows or refer to **Checksum Files** section if you're using other OS. **This is mandatory if you are updating already existing images.**

### Versioning File

`Version.ini` represents current Text and Client versions and is used for update purposes:

- `Text` version is used to trigger database updates, should be incremented by 1 upon every new release
- `Client` version is used to trigger client updates, should be incremented by 1 upon every new release
- `Sleeve` is used as a counter for maximum amount of sleeves in current version. Changing it will trigger client updates.

### Checksum Files

`.md5sums` files are being auto generated by md5deep software, individual lines are ordered alphabetically by file name. They are used to perform a client-side integrity check of the images folder and then sync missing or outdated images. To re-generate the files, from the root execute two commands:

`.\md5deep64.exe -l .\CardSprite\* | sort /+37 > CardSprite.md5sums`

`.\md5deep64.exe -l .\CardSpriteMini2\* | sort /+37 > CardSpriteMini2.md5sums`

## Tools

The primary text editor of choice that most of the team uses is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can download it to work with CFA database locally or launch it right from this repository's page by hitting the dot (period) key on your keyboard.

There are a few reasons for that, but mainly it's that it can support Windows-1251 encoding without issues, allows for quick search among multiple text files, but most importantly, it has support for GML syntax as a plug-in. It also supports git out of the box and has UI that does not require command line knowledge.

CFA repository is already configured to support WIndows-1251 encoding for VSCode, it is also configured for this extension to highlight the GML syntax: [GML Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liaronce.gml-support) (if you're working locally you have to install it first).

If you use any other editors and will be able to configure it in a similar fashion, don't hesitate to add the configuration to this repository as well.

## Basic Card Syntax

Any `.txt` file in this repository represents a script that is being executed at the launch of CFA. Every script is being executed line by line, from top to bottom. Here is a sample card syntax:

```
CardStat = 8230
{
global.CardName[CardStat] = 'Chakrabarthi Divine Dragon, Nirvana'
global.CardText[CardStat] = 'Dragon Empire/Flame Dragon

ACT [VC] 1/Turn: COST [Discard a card from your hand], choose a grade 0 card from your drop, and call it to RC.

AUTO [VC]: When this unit attacks, COST [Counter Blast 1], and this unit and all of your units with the overDress ability get power +10000 until end of turn.'
global.UnitGrade[CardStat] = 3
global.DCards[CardStat] = 1
}
global.PersonaRide[CardStat] = 1
global.PowerStat[CardStat] = 13000
global.DefensePowerStat[CardStat] = 0
```

First, this script assigns number 8230 to CardStat variable, this is the card's number in the database.
Then it writes a bunch of properties to arrays that are added to the global visibility scope (hence the `global.` syntax). Let's take a look at them one by one:

```
global.CardName[CardStat] = 'Chakrabarthi Divine Dragon, Nirvana'
```

This line writes the card's name into the global array `CardName`.

Notice how it uses single quotes to delimit string values. Single quotes in GML allow for use of double quotes inside the text, which can be quite useful for CFA. It also allows to use line breaks inside the string (which we will see actively being used in the next line).

But it also means that single quotation marks cannot be used as apostrophes. Instead, CFA database uses a special character from Windows-1251 encoding called **"right single quotation mark"** - `’`. If you use Windows and have a numpad on your keyboard, you can add that character by inputting number 39 on your numpad while holding left Alt key. Alternatively, you can just copy it from somewhere. VSCode usually highlights this character in a yellow box as a warning for it's visual similarity to a normal single quote.

By the way, those curly braces before this line don't add anything to the syntax, they are just used for separating main database properties from mechanical properties such as power and shield, a tradition that goes back to the early days of CFA when power and shield values were added into a separate file `UnitPower.txt`.

```
global.CardText[CardStat] = 'Dragon Empire/Flame Dragon

ACT [VC] 1/Turn: COST [Discard a card from your hand], choose a grade 0 card from your drop, and call it to RC.

AUTO [VC]: When this unit attacks, COST [Counter Blast 1], and this unit and all of your units with the overDress ability get power +10000 until end of turn.'
```

This line writes the text of the card into a global array `CardText`. On the first line of the text we always write first clan or nation and then card's races, each is separated by a slash (`/`).

After that come card's restrictions in parentheses, if there are any, like this:

```
(PREMIUM JP & EN: Restricted to 1.)
```

Then come the card's effects like they are written on the card. CFA has a syntax parser that replaces some words with icons so that the CFA textbox would look close to the real card's textbox.

Notice how `ACT`, `AUTO`, `CONT`, `1/Turn` or other effects and abilities are never surrounded by square brackets (which are only reserved for zone requirements) and circles are only written specifically as `VC`, `RC` and `GC`. Also numbers after cost, like `Counter Blast 1` never come in parentheses. Words like `power` are usually separated by spaces, even if they come after a slash so always try to go for `power +5000 / shield +5000`.

```
global.UnitGrade[CardStat] = 3
```

This line assign the card's grade to `UnitGrade` array _(even if it isn't a unit, the name comes from a time when there were only Units in the game)_.

```
global.DCards[CardStat] = 1
```

This line assigns the card's nation code. All cards in a file usually come from the same nation so they all have the same number, just copy it.

If a card has multiple nations, add it to the file of the nation that comes first on the card itself, and then write the second one into `global.DCards2[CardStat]` property.

If a clan has clan instead of or in addition to the nation, we add it using `global.CardInClan[CardStat]` property. One can be in multiple clans as well, using syntax similar to nations: `global.CardInClan2[CardStat]`. The game supports clan definitions of up to `global.CardInClan6[CardStat]`, but only two nations at the same time.

For cards that belong to all clans and nations we use `Cray Elemental.txt` text file and a specific number.

Also, keep in mind, that cards that have `DCards` parameter added to them are considered legal in the Standard format. Legality in formats such as V and Premium will be outlined later in this document.

```
global.PersonaRide[CardStat] = 1
```

This next line adds the Persona Ride ability to the card, which is usually present for all Grade 3 cards in the Standard format (as of writing of this document). There are also properties for other card abilities that will be discussed later in this document as well.

```
global.PowerStat[CardStat] = 13000
global.DefensePowerStat[CardStat] = 0
```

These two lines add the card's original power to the `PowerStat` and original shield value to the `DefensePowerStat` arrays. If a card has no shield or it's original power is 0, you can just omit this parameter, but there are no guidelines as to keep it or not, so you can either omit it or declare it as 0, both are functionally identical.

After adding new cards, do not forget to update the `global.AllCard` parameter in `NoUse.txt` file to increase the maximum amount of cards allowed in CFA.

## Advanced Card Syntax

This section covers specific syntax that is used by some cards in the database, starting from more common parameters to more obscure ones.

Note that older cards have these properties hard-coded into CFA client.
```

### :skull: Ultimate Stride G Zone auto removal

```
global.DeleteAllExtraInEndPhase[5235] = 1
```

### :x: Card restriction label (in deck editor)

```

global.CardBanned[CardStat] = 1 // display the red "Banned" label
```

### :eye: Cards hidden in the editor

```
global.CardInClan[CardStat] = 29 // technical clan category that is never shown in the editor

global.DCards[CardStat] = 8 // technical nation category that is only shown if it has another clan or nation (e.g. Touken Ranbu)

global.DontShowInDeckEditor[CardStat] // hides the card in the editor regardless of clan/nation
```

### :performing_arts: Double-faced cards

```
global.AnotherSide[CardStat] = 1234 // that other side card should be hidden in deck editor (see previous section)
```

### :recycle: Re-assigned cards (for accidentally added duplicate cards)

```

global.CocoAdd[CardStat] = 1 // effect specific to Scarlet Witch, Coco - functionally identical to global.ProtectAdd[CardStat] = 1
```

## Token Generator Syntax

This section covers what is called "token generators". Those are the cards that have the ability to create other card - usually tokens, but sometimes is used for markers as well (such as Dragontree marker).

Note that it is not used for Imaginary Gift generation, those are covered separately in one of the sections before.

### ??? Basic token generator

```
global.TokenSummoner[CardStat] = 1001
```

ID of the card that will be generated by this card.

```
global.TokenSummonerPosition[CardStat] = 'VR'
```

`'V'` for when placed on VC, `'R'` for when placed on RC, `'VR'` for when placed on either VC or RC. `'SHIFT'` allows to generate tokens by clicking the card while holding Shift key.

Don't forget to add the tip to the card text if you the use `'SHIFT'` option, the tip is mandatory unless it really doesn't fit into the text box.

The last option for this parameter is `'RodeUpon'`, and it should be only specifically used in conjunction with `TokenSummonerRodeUponNumber` parameter:

```
global.TokenSummonerRodeUponNumber[CardStat] = 1234
```

The token summoner effect is triggered when the card is ridden by a card with ID specified in that parameter.

```
global.TokenSummonerQuantity[CardStat] = 2
```

This is an optional parameter which is used to assign fixed quantity of tokens to generate. Currently only supports values of 1 and 2.

If you assign this parameter, the first question when the player clicks the card will be: "Activate the skill of "[CARDNAME]"?" with possible answers - Yes/No.

Otherwise, the first question will be: "How many tokens do you want to call?" with possible answers - 0/1/2.

### ????? Token generator with choice options

```
global.TokenSummoner[CardStat] = 1001
global.TokenSummoner2[CardStat] = 1002
global.TokenSummoner3[CardStat] = 1003
```

IDs of the cards that can be generated by this card, assigned to different buttons for player to choose from. `TokenSummoner2` is mandatory for multiple choice, while `TokenSummoner3` is optional. Maximum of three options are supported.

```
global.TokenSummonerPosition[CardStat] = 'VR'
```

Works exactly the same as for token generator without choice options.

```
global.TokenSummoner2Text[CardStat] = "Which token do you want to call?"
global.TokenSummoner2Button1[CardStat] = "5000"
global.TokenSummoner2Button2[CardStat] = "10000"
global.TokenSummoner2Button3[CardStat] = "15000"
```

Text values for the prompt that allows choice selection. `TokenSummoner2Text` should contain the text of the question, `TokenSummoner2Button1` through 3 contain text for the three options (should be relatively short to fit in, please try it out in the Test room before submitting).

```
global.TokenSummonerQuantity[CardStat] = 3
```

Works exactly the same as for token generator without choice options.

## Card Search Effect Syntax

This section covers the syntax of a special effect that can be used to search the top cards of the library at will.

The current convention is to only use this effect **when necessary**, for example when the effect instructs to "shuffle the rest and put them on the bottom of your deck". Effects like that **cannot be executed manually** so we add them per se.

```
global.SearchEffect[CardStat] = 1
```

Should be assigned to 1 to make the effect work.

```
global.SearchEffectPosition[CardStat] = 'V'
```

`'SHIFT'` / `'VR'` / `'V'` / `'R'` - position of activation, works similarly to `TokenSummoner`.

```
global.SearchEffectLookAtQuantity[CardStat] = 7
```

Number of cards to look at

```
global.SearchEffectMode[CardStat] = 'CheckRace'
```

Search effect mode. Can be one of the following:

- `'Card'` - find by specified card ID (arguments 1, 2 and 3)
- `'Clan'` - find by Clan ID (argument 1) and grade >= argument 2
- `'NoClan'` - find any card with grade >= argument 2 (argument 1 should be omitted)
- `'CheckGrade'` - find a card of specified grade only
- `'CheckGradeOrLess'` - find any card with grade <= argument 2 (argument 1 should be omitted)
- `'CheckNameAndGradeOrLess'` - find a card that has argument 1 as a substring in its name with grade <= argument 2. Set argument 1 to arbitrary huge number (e.g. 1000) to use just as a name search
- `'CheckCrit'` - checks if card has a crit, arguments are ignored
- `'CheckRace'` - checks is unit has said race (looks at the combination of forward slash "/" + name in card text). Argument 2 can be ignored or used as additional race.
- `'CheckRaceOrName'` - checks is unit has said race (looks at the combination of forward slash "/" + name in card text) or has argument 2 as a substring in its name.

```
global.SearchEffectArgument1[CardStat] = 'Humanity'
global.SearchEffectArgument2[CardStat] = 'Valkyrie'
global.SearchEffectArgument3[CardStat] = 0
```

Search function aruments, use depends on `SearchEffectMode` parameter. Third argument is omitted unless `'Card'` search mode is used.

```
global.ActivateSearchFoundAction[CardStat] = 'AddToHandUpTo'
```

Where to put found cards.

- `'AddToHand'` - put found cards into hand
- `'V'` - ride found cards
- `'SendToTopCard'` - send found cards to top of the deck
  - `UpTo` can be added to the end of any of those arguments to make the choice cancellable at any point, e.g. `'AddToHandUpTo'`, `'VUpTo'` and `'SendToTopCardUpTo'`

```
global.ActivateSearchRestAction[CardStat] = 'ShuffleBotDeck'
```

What to do with the rest of the cards

- `'Shu'` - shuffle into the deck
- `'SelectBot'` - select in which order to put cards to the bottom of the deck
- `'ShuffleBotDeck'` - shuffle the rest and put them on the bottom of the deck (primary mode at this point)

```
global.SearchEffectFindQuantity[CardStat] = 1
```

Maximum amount of cards allowed to be taken.
